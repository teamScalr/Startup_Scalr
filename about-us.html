                    <p>They say age is just a number, but the journey to success is measured in determination.
                        It took me 3 intense years of <br> research, faced failures, and embraced the lessons on the

                        road to launching Startup Scalr.
                        <br> <br>
                        In the business world, some may see youth as inexperience,<br> but every setback was a
                        lesson, and every doubt was a <br> chance to prove resilience. Your thoughts are valid, your
                        <br>
                        dreams are worth chasing, and the journey is worth every <br> moment.
                        <br> <br>
                        To every aspiring entrepreneur out there: Believe in yourself, <br>don't let go of your
                        dreams. It takes time, it's challenging, but <br> the destination is undeniably worth it.
